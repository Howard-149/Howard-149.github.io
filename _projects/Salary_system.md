During my time as a part-time software engineer at <a href="https://www.u-media.com.tw/">UMEDIA Communications Inc.</a>, I worked in a small team of four to develop a new in-house payroll system using TypeScript, Sequelize, and OracleDB. The system automated salary processing for over 200 employees, significantly reducing manual workload and errors.

I also designed an intuitive payroll management dashboard that streamlined reporting and incorporated feedback from senior management to improve usability. In addition, I implemented real-time data synchronization between the HR and payroll systems, eliminating the need for manual reconciliation and ensuring data consistency across platforms.
