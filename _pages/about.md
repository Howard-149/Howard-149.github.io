I am an incoming MIIS student in the [Language Technologies Institute](https://lti.cmu.edu/) at Carnegie Mellon University. 

Previously, I received my B.S. in Electrical Engineering from National Taiwan University in Taiwan. As an undergraduate, I conducted research under the supervision of [Prof. Hung-Yi Lee](https://speech.ee.ntu.edu.tw/~hylee/), focusing on speech processing and machine learning.
